        We want to be the best place for accessing great tutorial conent on
        the web, and we're passionate about providing a platform for experts

    </dd>
    <dt>Can you help me edit/revise the article?</dt>
    <dd>
        Yes! That's why we've built the editing tools on this site. It's easy
        to share a link to your article on social media and crowdsource
        expert-level editors for your topic.  You'll be able to see suggestions
        from the community and accept the changes you want.
    </dd>
    <dt>Can I cross-post on my own blog?</dt>
    <dd>
        Yes!  But from an SEO perspective, Google will hit us with a duplicate
        content penalty if we both post it without being careful about it.
        Here is what to do:

        <ol>
            <li>
                Wait 2 weeks before posting, from the day it goes live on
                HackHands
            </li>
            <li>
                From inside your blog's version of the article, link back to
                the original source on HackHands, using the tag
                "rel=canonical".  The canonical tag makes it clear to Google
                that the content is syndicated.  See this article:
                <a href="http://www.shoutmeloud.com/relcanonical-wordpresss-content-syndication-seo.html">Canonical tag</a>
            </li>
        </ol>
    </dd>
    <dt>What types of articles are you looking for?</dt>
    <dd>
        We're generally looking for tutorials on programing with X where X is
        a technology or library you're passionate about.
    </dd>
    <dt>How long should the article be?</dt>
    <dd>
        What's most important is that its a definitive article on the subject,
        is super useful, and is linked-to from other sites.  Longform articles
        are a great fit for this.
    </dd>
    <dt>What type of content are you looking for?</dt>
    <dd>
        <p>
            In general, content marketing is very hit-driven.  95% of posts
            don't get results, but the ones that do make up for all the others
            that don't.  So that's why the only strategy that generally works
            is to write fewer pieces that are more definitive in nature.
        </p>
        <p>
            The goal is that when someone does a google search for this
            subject, that your article appears on the first page of results.
            For that to occur, we need the quality of the content to be high
            enough that many other sites link into your article because its
            definitive.
        </p>
    </dd>
    <dt>How do I know if my article idea has a good chance of getting high traffic?</dt>
    <dd>
        One easy thing you can do is to check-out the competition for SEO for
        this particular subject.  Try doing a quick search now for some topics
        that interest you.  Competition is generally OK so long as there is
        enough unique/useful content that sets your article apart from the
        competition.  Are there ideas you can talk about in your proposed
        article that hasn't already been written?  Enough interesting unique
        contributions that can be added that moves the world's knowledge
        forward?  Those are some things to think about.
