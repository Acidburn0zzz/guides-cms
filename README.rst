=============

`hack.guides() <http://www.pluralsight.com/guides/>`_ is an
open-source CMS based on `Markdown <http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/>`_
and `Github <http://github.com>`_ written by-developers, for-developers. The
CMS is open-source (this repo).  All the content i.e. hacker guides are also
stored in an open-source Github repo located
`here <https://github.com/pluralsight/tutorials>`_.
See `the official hack.guides() website <http://www.pluralsight.com/guides/>`_ for an example of what a running version of this CMS looks like.

The aspiration of hack.guides() is to be an open-source community movement to
help bring knowledge to the world. Software developers learn new skills, and
collaborate together on technical writing. Ultimately we aspire to have this
content delivered to other spoken languages through a community of volunteer
translators. Our vision is to democratize professional technology learning.

hack.guides() is subsidized by `Pluralsight <a http://www.pluralsight.com>`_.
It is open-sourced via the AGPL 3.0 license.
